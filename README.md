Team Project - Image Classifier Project Specifications

1.	Create an Image Classifier (CNN model) to classify images of fruits correctly.
2.	A Fruits dataset is provided that consists of these 4 classes: 
  o	Apple only
  o	Orange only
  o	Banana only
  o	A mix of the above 3 fruits
3.	Use the images in Train.zip and Test.zip to train and test your image classifier.
4.	Document your experiments and results in improving your model’s accuracy.
5.	The following activities can improve your model’s accuracy: 
o	Balance out the number of samples in each class
o	Correct any mis-labelling in any of the 4 classes
o	Image Augmentation to generate more data
6.	Use Matplotlib to generate any plots that you think can help the reader understand your work better.
